* Summary
** BSC software in a picture

** Defining strings to software (I)

Retrieve Remote Data Directly (*R2D2*) is a tool to download data
using different protocols and sources like http, ftp, opendap, mars
(ECMWF), etc.

Correctness Checker for Climate Predictions and Observations (*C3PO*)
is a tool that modifies the original files downloaded from external
sources (with R2D2) to the common ES format.

** Defining strings to software (II)

*startR*: Retrieval and processing of multidimensional datasets

*s2dverification* (seasonal to decadal verification) is an R framework
that aids in the analysis of forecasts from the data retrieval stage,
through computation of statistics and skill scores against
observations, to visualisation of data and results

** Defining strings to software (III)

*Autosubmit*: a versatile tool to manage Weather and Climate Experiments
in diverse Supercomputing Environments.

The performance tools developed at BSC are an open-source project
targeting not only to detect performance problems but to understand
the applications' behavior.

*ecFlow* is a C++ application and features a client-server
model. Installation for server and clients is the same.

ecFlow can submit tasks directly to the relevant queuing system on the
target machine.

ecFlow submits jobs and receives acknowledgements from jobs when they
change status and when they send events. It does this using child
commands embedded in the ecFlow scripts
