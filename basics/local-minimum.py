# To find a local minimum of a function using gradient descent, one takes steps proportional to the negative of the gradient (or approximate gradient) of the function at the current point

# From calculation, it is expected that the local minimum occurs at x=9/4

gamma = 0.01 # step size multiplier
precision = 0.00001

iters = 0 #iteration counter

df = lambda x: 4 * x**3 - 9 * x**2

while (previous_step_size > precision) & (iters < max_iters):

    cur_x -= gamma * df(prev_x)
